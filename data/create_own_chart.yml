  # Text
  - title: Text
    text: Graphs don’t contain much text, so existing text must encapsulate your message and pack a punch.
    block_text:
      - title: 6 - 12 word descriptive title is left-justified in upper left corner
        text: Short titles enable readers to comprehend takeaway messages even while quickly skimming the graph. Rather than a generic phrase, use a descriptive sentence that encapsulates the graph’s finding.
      - title: Text is horizontal
        text: Titles, subtitles, annotations and data labels are horizontal (not vertical or diagonal). Line labels and axis labels can deviate from this rule and still receive full points.
      - title: Subtitle and/or annotations provide additional information
        text: Subtitles and annotations (call-out text within the graph) can add explanatory and interpretive power to a graph. Use them to answer questions a viewer might have or to highlight one or two data points.
      - title: Data are labeled directly
        text: Position data labels near the data rather than in a separate legend (for example, on top of or next to bars or pie slices, and next to lines in line charts). Eliminate/embed legends when possible because eye movement back and forth between the legend and the data can interrupt the brain’s attempts to interpret the graph.
      - title: Text size is hierarchical and readable
        text: Titles are in a larger size than subtitles or annotations, which are larger than labels, which are larger than axis labels, which are larger than source information. The smallest text - axis labels - are at least 9 point font size on paper, at least 20 on screen.
      - title: Labels are used sparingly
        text: Focus attention by removing the redundancy. For example, in line charts, label every other year on an axis.

  # Arrangement
  - title: Arrangement
    text: Improper arrangement of graph elements can confuse readers at best and mislead viewer at worst. Thoughtful arrangement makes a data visualization easier for a viewer to interpret.
    block_text:
      - title: Proportions are accurate
        text: A viewer should be able to take a ruler to measure the length or area of the graph and find that it matches the relationship in the underlying data.
      - title: Graph is two-dimensional
        text: Avoid three-dimensional displays, bevels and others distortions.
      - title: Data are intentionally ordered
        text: Data should be displayed in an order that makes logical sense to the viewer. Data may be ordered by frequency counts (for example, from greatest to least for nominal categories), by grouping or bins (for example, histograms), by time period (for example, line charts), alphabetically, etc.
      - title: Display is free from decoration
        text: Graph is free from clipart or other illustrations used solely for decoration. Some graphics, like icons, can support interpretation.
      - title: Axis intervals are equidistant
        text: The spaces between axis intervals should be the same unit, even if every axis interval isn’t labeled.

  # Color
  - title: Color
    text: Keep culture-laden color connotations in mind.
    block_text:
      - title: Color scheme is intentional
        text: Colors should represent brand or other intentional choice, not default color schemes. Use online tools to identify brand colors and others that are compatible.
      - title: Color is legible for people with colorblindness
        text: Avoid red-green and yellow-blue combinations when those colors touch one another.
      - title: Color is used to highlight key patterns
        text: Data should be displayed in an order that makes logical sense to the viewer. Data may be ordered by frequency counts (for example, from greatest to least for nominal categories), by grouping or bins (for example, histograms), by time period (for example, line charts), alphabetically, etc.
      - title: Text sufficiently contrasts background
        text: Black/very dark text against a white/transparent background is easiest to read.
      - title: Color is legible when printed in black and white
        text: When printed or photocopied in black and white, the viewer should still be able to see patterns in the data.

  # Lines
  - title: Lines
    text: Excessive lines - gridlines, borders, tick marks and axes - can add clutter or noise to a graph, so eliminate them whenever they aren’t useful for interpreting the data.
    block_text:
      - title: Gridlines, if present, are muted
        text: Color should be faint gray, not black. Full points if no gridlines are used.
      - title: Axes do not have unnecessary tick marks
        text: Tick marks are useful in line graphs (to demarcate each point in time along the y-axis) but unnecessary in bar charts.
      - title: Graph does not have border line
        text: Graph should bleed the surrounding page or slide rather than being contained by a border.
      - title: Graph has one horizontal and one vertical axis
        text: Viewers can best interpret one x-axis and one y-axis, even if one is hidden. Don’t add a second y-axis.

  # Overall
  - title: Overall
    text: Graphs will catch a viewer’s attention so only visualize the data that needs attention. Too many graphics of unimportant information dilute the power of visualization.
    block_text:
      - title: Graph highlights significant finding or conclusion
        text: Graphs should have a “so what?” - either a practical or statistical significance (or both) to warrant their presence.
      - title: Contextualized or comparison data are present
        text: Comparisons - over time, across programs or subgroups of participants, etc.- help the viewer understand the significance of the data.
      - title: The type of graph is appropriate for data
        text: Data are displayed using a graph type appropriate for the relationship within the data. For example, change over time is displayed as a line graph, area chart, slope chart or dot plot.
      - title: Individual chart elements work together to reinforce the overarching takeaway message
        text: Choices about graph type, text, arrangement, color and lines should reinforce the same takeaway message.
      - title: The type of graph is appropriate for data
        text: Data are displayed using a graph type appropriate for the relationship within the data. For example, change over time is displayed as a line graph, area chart, slope chart or dot plot.
      - title: Individual chart elements work together to reinforce the overarching takeaway message
        text: Choices about graph type, text, arrangement, color and lines should reinforce the same takeaway message.
      - title: Graph has appropriate level of precision
        text: Few numeric labels need decimal places. When precision is important, choose a type of graph type that displays differences through length or points along a line (for example, bar charts, dot plots). When precision is less importante, you can use a graph that displays differences through angles or area (for example, pie charts, circle charts).
      - title: Score
        text: Well-formatted data visualizations score between 90-100% of available points. At this level, viewers are better able to read, interpret and retain content.
